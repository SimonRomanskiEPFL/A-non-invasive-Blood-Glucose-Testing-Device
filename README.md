# A-non-invasive-Blood-Glucose-Testing-Device

This work proposes a novel, non-invasive device for the blood glucose monitoring. Existing technologies are: the sample point test (requires patients to draw blood with a lancet several times daily) and the continuous glucose monitoring (uses a tiny sensor inserted beneath the skin that remains in place for a period of up to two weeks, assessing glucose levels in tissue fluid).

The proposed approach consist of a wristband with a high power NIR-LED that emits light. Using scattering effects in the skin, a photo-diode receives the NIR-light. Based on the correlation between scattering for the NIR-light at 940nm and the glucose level in the blood vessels, we can estimate the blood glucose level.

### This project does not come with code. Find more details about the concept in the slides and in the report!
